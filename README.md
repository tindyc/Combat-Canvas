## Project Brief
Code Institute London Hackathon project in conjuction with SODA Social and in partnership with Ex-Military Careers.COM ,came up with the initiative *supporting Veterans Mental Health*.

My team has chosen *The ART THERAPY GALLERY:A platform where veterans can submit and showcase their creativity work*.
   we believe that mental health  awareness is vital amongst VETERANS , their is overbearing stigma surrounding mental health with lack of educationa resources and the  society so many are left aliented . This project is dedicated to  help create a space for veterans  to express themselves and hope this will help to reduce the sitgam and promote cathartic therapy that ART can offer.

  This project is  also an opportunity for CI students to brainstorm and also to use their coding skills to develop apps and websites to support the veterans activities such as Wellness tracker, Veterans stories and other Mental health resources.

 In preparing for this project we have conducted research on some veterans websites and also partictipated in the *SODA* webinar with some veterans at present. This gave us more insights on what to develop for the project. 

The team has created Art work of Gallery to show case the veterans work. We have used Django and Python programming skills to develop the webpages and incorporated CRUD functionality (Create,Read,Update and Delete). Team has worked in Sprints using Agile methodology to deliver the project.

## UX 

The webpage contents and functionality has been developed with user interface and aesthetics focus in mind based on the user type(Veterans).

# User Stories


# Wireframes
We have created mockup screens of the webpage functionalities using Balsamic Software tool.
The initial draft of the wireframe was based on how user can navigate each page on the site however, the final product might be different due to team design thinking improvement.
