<div class="mental-health"><h3>Why Chose Art Therapy?</h3>
<p>Uk armed forces personnel who are currently surving are not offered art therapy as a potential theraputic tool. Our platform aims to bridge that gap and 
encourage the use of art to aid veterans mental health and combat mental health challenges such as PTSD, anxiety, depression and other stress related conditions.
In our footer you can find other helpful resources adressing the support avalible to veterans.
